# iOS environment setup guide

This file describes environment setup for iOS builds on macOS.

## Setting up the environment

* If your Mac uses ARM CPU (MacBook Pro M1, etc.), you have to install Rosetta: `sudo softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license`
* Install XCode via App Store.  
  * You might need to enable Rosetta for XCode if you want to run the app in iOS simulator because Flutter (as of v2.5.2)
[does not yet support `arm64` iOS simulators](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup#apple-silicon-arm64-macs).
Otherwise, you can get errors about missing pods
(missing includes from pods).
* Install dependencies:
  * `brew install bazelisk`
  * `brew install protobuf`
  * `sudo gem install cocoapods`
  * `python3 -m pip install --user numpy absl-py`
* Install Flutter:
  * Download flutter repo:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/tools && git clone --branch 2.10.5 --depth 1 https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git ~/tools/flutter
    ```

  * Add flutter binary folders to path: `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/tools/flutter/bin:$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"`  
    If you use zsh: `echo export PATH="\$PATH:\$HOME/tools/flutter/bin:\$HOME/.pub-cache/bin" >>~/.zshrc`
  * Enable protobuf plugin: `dart pub global activate protoc_plugin`
* Go to `ios` directory and install pods: `pod install`

## Tested environment

The app was built and tested successfully in this environment:

```shell
macOS Big Sur 11.6
Xcode: 12.5.1 (18212)

$ flutter --version
Flutter 2.10.5 • channel unknown • unknown source
Framework • revision 5464c5bac7 (5 weeks ago) • 2022-04-18 09:55:37 -0700
Engine • revision 57d3bac3dd
Tools • Dart 2.16.2 • DevTools 2.9.2

$ bazel --version
bazel 4.2.2

$ protoc --version
libprotoc 3.17.3

$ pod --version
1.11.2

$ python3 --version
Python 3.9.7
```

Note: the current version may crash with EXC_RESOURCE if built with XCode 13.0

## Changing application icon

[comment]: # (TODO move this somewhere?)

After building the application, if you would like to set a new application icon, use the following actions:

* Go to `pubspec.yaml` file in root folder
* Find `flutter_icons` configuration and change value of option `image_path` to the path of desirable application icon
* Use `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main` command to set the icon

Please note that iOS icons should not have any transparency. See more guidelines [here](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/app-icon/).

## Formatting

[comment]: # (TODO add info about installing other tools)

To automatically format your files you must have `clang-format` and `buildifier` in addition to build dependencies.

* `brew install clang-format`,
* `brew install buildifier`
