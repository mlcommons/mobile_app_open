## Setting up the environment

[comment]: # (Don't remove spaces at the end of lines, they force line breaks)

* Install Visual Studio: <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/>  
Visual Studio Community will suffice. At least Visual Studio 2019 is required.
* Install Chocolatey: <https://chocolatey.org>  
This is an optional step. You can download and install all of the dependencies from other sources.  
However, using Chocolatey greatly simplifies installation.
* Install dependencies:
  * `choco install -y git`
  * `choco install -y make`
  * `choco install -y bazel --version 4.2.2`
  * `choco install -y python3`
  * `choco install -y msys2`
  * `choco install -y flutter`
  * `choco install -y protoc`
  * **Note**: it's generally better to use the latest version of each tool, but bazel 5.x is incompatible with this project.
  You may need to also manually specify versions for other tools if they introduce breaking changes.
  You can refer to the [Tested environment](#tested-environment) section for versions.
* Configure python
  * You must have command `python3` in your PATH.  
  Python installed via Chocolatey provides only `python.exe` file, so you will need to create `python3` yourself.  
  At the moment of writing this instruction the default path for python is `C:/Python39/`.
  You can make a copy of `python.exe` file in the same directory and name it `python3.exe`.
  * Disable python dummy files provided by Windows
    * Go to `Settings` → `Apps` → `Apps & features` → `App execution aliases`
    * Disable `App Installer python.exe` amd `App Installer python3.exe`
  * Set `PYTHON_BIN_PATH` env pointing to your actual python executable  
  Bazel is able to locate python but it resolves it with backslashes in path which causes errors.
  Use forward slashes to mitigate this: `PYTHON_BIN_PATH=C:/Python39/python.exe`
* Set python path env, paths must use forward slashes
* Install python dependencies: `python3 -m pip install --user numpy absl-py`
* Add MSYS2 bin folder to PATH: `C:/tools/msys64/usr/bin`
* Enable protobuf plugin: `dart pub global activate protoc_plugin`
* Add dart pub cache bin folder to PATH: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Pub/Cache/bin`
* Enable Windows support in flutter: `flutter config --enable-windows-desktop`  
Windows support is still in beta, so it is disabled by default.
* Turn on the developer mode in Windows settings.
  * This option should be located in `Update & Security` → `For developers`.
  * Or you can open this page from command line: `start ms-settings:developers`

**Note**: If you have a WSL distro installed on your PC, you may need to set `BAZEL_SH` environment variable.
Without it bazel could call `bash` provided by WSL instead of MSYS2's one.
Put path to the `bash` command from MSYS2 there.
If you installed MSYS2 via Chocolatey, the path would be `C:/tools/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe`.

**Note**: Flutter may not work correctly if your temp directory is located on a RAM drive.
If you see error messages similar to
`Cannot resolve symbolic links, path = 'Z:\temp\pub_85cf1e20' (OS Error: Incorrect function., errno = 1)`,
move your temp directory location.  
You can do this for current terminal only, if you don't want to move it permanently:

```batch
:: for cmd
set "TEMP=%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp"
set "TMP=%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp"
```

```powershell
# for PowerShell
$env:TEMP=$env:USERPROFILE+'\AppData\Local\Temp'
$env:TMP=$env:USERPROFILE+'\AppData\Local\Temp'
```

## Tested environment

The app was built and tested successfully in this environment:

```shell
Windows 20H2 (build 19042.928)
Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, version 16.11.2

λ flutter --version
Flutter 2.5.0 • channel unknown • unknown source
Framework • revision 4cc385b4b8 (6 months ago) • 2021-09-07 23:01:49 -0700
Engine • revision f0826da7ef
Tools • Dart 2.14.0

λ bazel --version
bazel 4.2.2

λ protoc --version
libprotoc 3.17.3

λ python3 --version
Python 3.9.7
```

## Formatting

You can use `make format` and `make lint` to format and check files.

You need to install dependencies for these commands to work:

* `choco install -y buildifier`
* clang-format:
  * You can install the whole LLVM package `choco install llvm -y`,
  * Or you can download it separately  
  The link can be found at the very bottom of the [LLVM Snapshot Builds page](https://llvm.org/builds/).
  Currently available version is [clang-format-6923b0a7.exe](https://prereleases.llvm.org/win-snapshots/clang-format-6923b0a7.exe).
  Rename downloaded file to clang-format.exe and place it somewhere in your `PATH`.
* `choco install -y nodejs`
* `choco install -y dos2unix`
* `choco install -y markdownlint-cli`
* `pip install --user yamllint`
