This repository contains sources of MLPerf benchmark application.

[comment]: # (Don't remove spaces at the end of lines, they force line breaks)
Currently we only support iOS.  
Support for Windows is in progress.
You can build and launch the app on Windows,
but the backend and UI don't have all of the required optimizations,
so you will likely see a lot of performance and UX issues.
