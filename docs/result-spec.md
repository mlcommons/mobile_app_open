# Result format

This file explains the full format for results generated by this app.

This format is used when saving results locally on device, when uploading them to the online database,
and when fetching them from the online database.

Here is an example result file: [extended_result_unittest.json](../flutter/unit_test/data/extended_result_unittest.json)

## General structure

Results are serialized as JSON.

Results must be a map with the following items in the root level:

* `meta`: map
  * `uuid`: string  
  UUID is generated by the app when all benchmarks are finished.
  * `upload_date`: string  
  Datetime of the moment when web service received the upload request
  Format is Iso 8601 in UTC timezone: `2022-04-14T03:54:54.687Z`
* `results`: list of maps. See [List of benchmark-specific results](#benchmark-specific-results) section
* `environment_info`: map. See [Environment info](#environment-info) section
* `build_info`: map. See [Build info](#application-build-info) section

## Benchmark-specific results

Each benchmark generates one map with results.

For example, if you select 3 benchmarks, you will get a list with 3 items, each describing specific benchmark.

Almost all of the settings are the same for performance and accuracy runs so they are united.

If Submission mode is disabled, `accuracy_run` will be null for all results.
If you enable Submission mode, both `performance_run` and `accuracy_run` values will be filled.
